Inspired by too many hours of watching old [Banff Film Festival](https://adventureblog.net/2020/03/banff-film-festival-cancels-tour-offers-movies-online-for-free.html) reels, countless circles by bicycle around Lake Washington during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, and evenings spent gazing across the Puget Sound to the Eastern Olympics, I asked some friends if they wanted to join me on a bicycle tour to Mount Washington in the Olympic range, and then on a scramble up the mountain. Mostly I wanted to feel like a badass while biking with a ice ax strapped to the top tube of my bike. I've done a few short cycling tours and lots of backpacking, but it was my first "bike mountaineering" trip. Here's what I learned about leading this kind of adventure.

1. Encourage your friends to pack efficiently

I could write a long post about how to pack for a bike touring trip and the "lightweight" philosophy. However, I find that kind of boring and lots of other people have that covered, for example, [here](https://andrewskurka.com/stupid-light-not-always-right-or-better/). What I *could have done* before the trip though, was to invite myself over to my friends' houses to give some input on their packing systems ahead of time. There are lots of tricks I've learned over time that don't involve buying expensive gear.

When bikepacking, it's tempting to feel like you can bring more since you are on a bike, but I don't think you want to carry any more than you would if you were backpacking. This is a crucial mistake I have made in the past! You will feel every ounce when you are on mile 60 and going uphill. And even more important than packing a backpack, you want to make sure everything is as aerodynamic as possible and nothing is going to get loose.

Maybe we all would have had an easier ride if we brought less crap, but it's hard to have a bad time when you have such fantastic company. In the end, I don't care about folks being new to something or not doing something the way I would do it as much as I care about the positive energy they bring to the trip.

2. Enjoy the journey, don't fixate on the destination

Sometimes you have to know how to efficiently manage your time in order to achieve your objectives, but sometimes it's important to pause to appreciate the randomness of American small town life. One of the best things about bike touring, in my opinion, is the ability to notice and appreciate landscapes that you'd never see in a car. On a bike, you purposely travel on quieter paths and take out-of-they-way routes. It becomes more natural to stop and talk to the people who live in the places you're biking through and to try to understand what their lives are like.

3. Provide positive affirmations

Mountaineering is scary and hard, but the rewards are great. I don't know how to best balance encouraging people to push their limits when I know that they can do something and respecting their fears and reservations. Sometimes all a partner needs a positive affirmation: "I know you've got this!" "Take a deep breath and make sure you have 3 points of contact!" Whatever decision the group ends up making about continuing on a route, it's always a good idea to tell your climbing partners that you believe in them.

5. Eat lots of donuts

Biking takes a lot of energy. Add 30+ pounds of weight to your bike and 5,000 feet of elevation, and you're going to need a lot of calories. YOU WILL NEED DONUTS. Eat more to avoid depletion and grumpiness.

And that is basically all that I think is important for organizing a bike mountaineering trip. I can't wait for our second adventure!
